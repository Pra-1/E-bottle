# E-bottle
# Abstract
The abstract provides a concise overview of an electric bottle with built-in cooling and heating functionalities.
This innovative device aims to revolutionize the way beverages are stored and maintained at desired temperatures.
By integrating both cooling and heating capabilities within a portable bottle, users can enjoy their preferred drinks at their preferred temperature, whether hot or cold.
The electric bottle employs advanced thermoelectric technology to achieve efficient cooling and heating.
The cooling functionality utilizes the Peltier effect, allowing the bottle to lower the temperature of beverages inside by transferring heat from the liquid to the external environment. 
Similarly, the heating functionality employs the same technology in reverse, effectively raising the temperature of the contents.
To provide user-friendly control, the electric bottle is equipped with an intuitive interface that allows for easy temperature adjustment. 
Users can set their desired temperature using the integrated control panel or a companion smartphone application. 
The bottle is equipped with sensors that monitor and maintain the desired temperature, ensuring optimal enjoyment of the beverage for an extended period.
